# Nutanix Ansible Collection

The repo https://github.com/yannickstruyf3/nutanix-ansible contains an Ansible collection (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for Nutanix.

The collection is not yet published on Ansible Galaxy. 

**Note**: This repo is **NOT** officially supported by Nutanix. Some API's (for example Karbon) are not yet GA and are still subjected to change.

You can find example playbooks in the `examples` folder. Use the `template_inventory.yml` file as a baseline for configuring your inventory.
